My name is Yassine Mhedhbi and I am currently an AI solution Developer at Deloitte Omnia. I pursued a joint major in Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, a public research university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 2015 to 2019. I'm interested in deep learning and its application in computer vision, robotics and NLP.

I'm an Ex professional Taekwondo player and I enjoy playing soccer in my spare time. I love travelling and discovering new cultures.
